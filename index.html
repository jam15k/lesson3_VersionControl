            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control is a system that records all the changes to a file or to a set of files over time. These recording are accessible and you can recall specific versions at any time. A VCS, version control system, is extremely useful for graphic designers, so that they can have saved files of every single image layout that has been created. Using VCS allows you to revert files back to a previous state, revert the entire project back to a previous state, compare changes over time, see who last modified something that might be causing a problem, who introduced an issue and when, and more.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git first originated in 2005, before that, changes to software were passed around as patches and archived files through Linux kernel. In 2005, the relationship between the community that developed the Linux kernel and the commercial company that developed BitKeeper broke down, and the tools free-of-charge status was revoked. After that, the creators came together to develop their own tool based on their previous mistakes. The new system was faster, simpler , fully distributed, able to handle large projects, and had a strong support for non-linear development. This system was Git, it has evolved and matured to be easy to use and yet retain these initial qualities. It’s incredibly fast, it’s very efficient with large projects, and it has an incredible branching system for non-linear development</p>

            <p class="lead">So, what is Git in a nutshell? This is an important section to absorb, because if you understand what Git is and the fundamentals of how it works, then using Git effectively will probably be much easier for you. As you learn Git, try to clear your mind of the things you may know about other VCSs, such as Subversion and Perforce; doing so will help you avoid subtle confusion when using the tool. Git stores and thinks about information much differently than these other systems, even though the user interface is fairly similar, and understanding those differences will help prevent you from becoming confused while using it.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Initializing a Repository in an Existing Directory: If you’re starting to track an existing project in Git, you need to go to the project’s directory. If you’ve never done this, it looks a little different depending on which system you’re running: for Windows: $ cd /c/user/your_repository and type: $ git init This creates a new subdirectory named .git that contains all of your necessary repository files – a Git repository skeleton. Cloning an Existing Repository You clone a repository with git clone <url>. For example, if you want to clone the Git linkable library called libgit2, you can do so like this: $ git clone https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">GitHub is the single largest host for Git repositories, and is the central point of collaboration for millions of developers and projects. A large percentage of all Git repositories are hosted on GitHub, and many open-source projects use it for Git hosting, issue tracking, code review, and other things. So while it’s not a direct part of the Git open source project, there’s a good chance that you’ll want or need to interact with GitHub at some point while using Git professionally. When setting up an account you should worry about SSH Access, your email addresses, two factor authentication, and your avatar.</p>
